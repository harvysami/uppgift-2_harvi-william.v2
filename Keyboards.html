            Mechanical switches have always been superior for speed and accuracy and before 2010, they were only used for typing, because they were made precisely 
                for that purpose. Razer then made the radical decision to use mechanical switches for a gaming keyboard and that birthed the world’s very first 
                gaming mechanical keyboard, the Razer BlackWidow.<br>
                <br>Four years later, Razer redefined the limits of gaming performance by creating mechanical switches that were designed specifically to meet
                 the demands of gaming - the Razer™ Mechanical Switch was born.<br>
                <br>Rigorously tested by eSports athletes under the most demanding conditions, Razer Mechanical Switches are perfectly tuned to the specific 
                needs of gamers. Featuring optimized actuation points and a durability that surpasses the competition, these impressive switches enable you to
                 execute your commands faster than before, for even longer.
